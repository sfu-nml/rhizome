# Rhizome

Rhizome is a modular cloud gaming platform designed for public cloud. The server-side streaming engine is built on NVDIA GRID GPU (EC2 G2 instance) and supports both hardware and software based video encoding with H.264 codec. Rhizome integrates USP-over-IP protocol to cast user inputs and supports almost any (thin-)client devices. To accomplish ultra-low latency and a low power consumption gaming experience on the client device, Rhizome further optimizes the thin-client configuration and its interaction modules.
